1 Utilize the "csv" module in Python to read the input CSV file, allowing for easy parsing of the data into rows and cells.

2 Iterate through each row and cell of the input CSV data. If the cell starts with the '=' sign, it indicates that it is a formula.

3 If the cell is a formula, use eval() function or a library like pandas to calculate the result.

4If the cell is not a formula, add the original cell value to the output row.

5 Use the csv module to write the output row to the output CSV file.

6 Repeat the process for all the rows in the input CSV file.

7 Close both the input and output CSV files.
